# URL Alert

A Chrome extension to parse URLs for internationalized domain names.
This may be a sign that the URL is an internationalized domain name (IDN) homograph attack ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack)).

Available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-alert/pflncfgmhaeckfmdgogffkbjkkogjgkh).


## Screenshot

Navigate to this Hacker News post [Phishing attack uses Unicode characters in domains to clone known safe sites](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14119713) where a few unicode URLs are given as examples.

Or try this site: https://www.аррӏе.com/ which tries to demonstrate "a flaw in the way unicode domains are handled in browsers".
